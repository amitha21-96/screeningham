The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."
"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.
The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.
The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!
The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.
Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.
As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.
"Dad, I don't think--"
Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.
"Dad!"
Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.
Then the bottom dropped out.
Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.
"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."
Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.
The other man I never want to disappoint.
The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.
Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.
Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.
Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.
Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.
A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.
"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"
Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.
"Welcome to Washington, sir!"
Langdon smiled. "Thank you."
"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."
Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.
"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"
Langdon hesitated and then nodded.
"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"
Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."
The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.
The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"
No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.
Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.
"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."
Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."
Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.
As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up
Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.
Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today 
that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.
Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.
Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.
CHAPTER 2
The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.
I am a masterpiece.
The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.
Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.
The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.
A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.
He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.
This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.
Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.
Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.
Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. 
Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. 
That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even 
if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.
Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.
My initiation served its purpose.
Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.
As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.
Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.
I am a masterpiece.
His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.
I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.
One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"
"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.
Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.
Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.
Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.
It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.
As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.
And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.
CHAPTER 3
Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.
Memorial Bridge already?
He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the 
forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.
Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air.
 Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.
America's Egyptian obelisk.
The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.
This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.
When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.
"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."
Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.
Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.
I hope he's okay.
Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his 
gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never 
dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.
A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.
Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.
Peter Solomon
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Good morning, Robert,
I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.
Peter
Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.
"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"
"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"
"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"
"Of course."
As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, 
Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.
All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."
Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."
Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."
"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."
"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"
"Of course not."
The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."
Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.
"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."
The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.
"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."
Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."
"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave 
on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."
Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"
"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."
I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"
The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."
Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"
"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and
 you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"
"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.
"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"
"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.
"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."
Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."
"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.
When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.
Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.
The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.
"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.
"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."
"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."
As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.
Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.
The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."
"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."
The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.
The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."
"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.
The visitor winced in pain.
"Sorry."
"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."
"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.
In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.
"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.
"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.
As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"
I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"
The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."
Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.
In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.
"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.
"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.
As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"
Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"
I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"
The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."
Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"
"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and
 you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"
"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.
"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"
"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.
"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."
Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."
"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.
When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.
Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.
The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.
"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.
"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."
"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."
As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.
Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.
The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."
"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."
The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.
The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."
"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.
The visitor winced in pain.
"Sorry."
"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."
"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.
The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."
"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."
The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.
The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."
"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.
The visitor winced in pain.
"Sorry."
"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."
"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.
In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.
"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.
"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.
As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"
"Yes?"

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."
Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."
The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.
The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.
Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement.
 I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!
When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.
Okay, I'm impressed.
The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.
The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.
Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.
At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.
"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.
Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."
"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."
Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"
The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."
"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.
This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.
No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.
Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.
It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.
Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.
Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater.

The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment.

Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization.

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization.

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization.

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

"An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world.

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line.

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization.

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment.

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

"An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment.

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world.

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world.

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. 
Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him.
 "You look pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground."

"I'm okay . . ." the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. "I'll get out on the next level." I can't breathe.

The man leaned closer. "I thought by now you would have gotten over this." He brushed the child's cheek affectionately.

The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ears. I can't breathe.
 I've got to get out of this box!

The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. 
Far beneath them, the streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.

Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on.

As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.

"Dad, I don't think--"

Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.

"Dad!"

Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.

Then the bottom dropped out.

Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. 
He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. 
In the background, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.

"Mr. Langdon?" The intercom crackled overhead. "We're on final approach."

Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. 
He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted. 
The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's 
unexpected invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.

The other man I never want to disappoint.

The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago,
 in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family dynasty and massive wealth,
 Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.

Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk,
 rising on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555- foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's heart.
 All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.
 Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.

Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. 
The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.

Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. 
The cold January air felt liberating.

Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.

A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.

"Hello! Hello!" a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. "Professor Langdon?"

Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, 
waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.

"Welcome to Washington, sir!"

Langdon smiled. "Thank you."

"My name is Pam, from passenger services." The woman spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. 
"If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting."

Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
 A taxi stand for the rich and famous.

"I hate to embarrass you, Professor," the woman said, sounding sheepish, 
"but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren't you?"

Langdon hesitated and then nodded.

"I thought so!" she said, beaming. "My book group read your book about the sacred
 feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!"

Langdon smiled. "Scandal wasn't really my intention."

The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. "I'm sorry. 
Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it's your own fault." She playfully motioned to his clothing. "Your uniform gave you away." My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, author photos, and social events.

The woman laughed. "Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!"

No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.

Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, 
and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia 
worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of "Croat" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.

"Thanks for the advice," Langdon said with a chuckle. "I'll consider a tie in the future."

Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked 
near the terminal and held up his finger. "Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.
" He opened the passenger door. "Good evening, sir. Welcome to Washington."

Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car.
 The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled water, and the basket of hot muffins.
 Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.

As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. 
"This is Beltway Limousine," the driver said with professional efficiency. 
"I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed." He paused. "Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived,
 and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You're welcome, sir." He hung up.

Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, 
allowing him to manage his substantial power with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.

Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. 
The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead.

Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.

Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon's arrival.

CHAPTER 2

The one who called himself Mal'akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure 
as the sharp tool plunged in and out of his flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . .
 as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.

I am a masterpiece.

The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the 
tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult of ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed 
themselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring the physical pain of embellishment and 
emerging changed beings.

Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one's flesh, tattoos had become
 a rite of passage shared by millions of people in the modern age--everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core 
drug users to suburban housewives.

The act of tattooing one's skin was a transformative declaration of power, an announcement to the world: I am
 in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted 
millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia 
and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal shell.

A single bell chimed on Mal'akh's grandfather clock, and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped
 the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawling mansion
 was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. 
The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques--a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.

He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the distance. 
The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with solemn power against the dark winter sky.

This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.

Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or the ingenious way in which it had been hidden. 
To this day, it remained this country's greatest untold secret. 
Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.

Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal'akh thought.

Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America's most influential men, 
Mal'akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the world's oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal'akh's new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even if Mal'akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.

Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.

My initiation served its purpose.

Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. 
Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of a castrato singing the "Lux Aeterna" 
from the Verdi Requiem--a reminder of a previous life. Mal'akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering "Dies Irae.
" Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as
 he ascended on sinewy legs.

As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, 
Mal'akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancient ways. 
Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain.

Mal'akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. 
As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. 
Unable to resist, he turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, 
Mal'akh opened his robe to unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.

I am a masterpiece.

His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed
 with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars--his 
left leg spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed a decorated 
archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head 
in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal'akh's nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head 
were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.

I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.

One mortal man had seen Mal'akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man had shouted in fear. "Good God, you're a demon!"

"If you perceive me as such," Mal'akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels 
and demons were identical--interchangeable archetypes--all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel 
who conquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.

Mal'akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. 
There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooed flesh. 
This carefully guarded canvas was Mal'akh's only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, 
it would be filled. Although Mal'akh did not yet possess what he required to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.

Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. He closed his robe and 
walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city before him. It is buried out there somewhere.

Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal'akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a
 base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tattoos had disappeared.
 Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepared for this evening. 
When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smooth scalp and smiled.

It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.

As Mal'akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building.
 He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange all the pieces for tonight.

And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game.

CHAPTER 3

Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car's tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. 
Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were.

Memorial Bridge already?

He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passing beneath him.
 A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom had always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation's capital. Of all the places in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.

Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial--America's Pantheon, 
as many called it. Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity, 
its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens's ancient Parthenon. But it was farther away that Langdon saw the city's centerpiece--the same spire he had seen from the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks.

America's Egyptian obelisk.

The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminated against the sky
 like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon's oblique angle, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . 
swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit
 to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . 
and now I'm a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.

This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water, beginning his day 
as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Pool. His physique was not quite
 what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned,
 respectable for a man in his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way.

When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra 
coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen. This morning, however, he was 
surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? 
He pressed the button and listened to the message.

"Good morning, Professor Langdon, I'm terribly sorry for this early-morning call." The polite voice
 was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern accent. "My name is Anthony Jelbart, and 
I'm Peter Solomon's executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you're an early riser . . . 
he has been trying to reach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message, 
would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it's 202-329-5746."

Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and 
courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong.

Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.

I hope he's okay.

Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve years Langdon's senior, a father
 figure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision of semiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon's brilliance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon the courage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed that Peter Solomon, one of America's wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been the beginning of a truly gratifying friendship.

A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the 
ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared on buildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university--Yale.

Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as well.

Peter Solomon

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Good morning, Robert,

I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you can at 202-329- 5746.

Peter

Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call went through.

"Office of Peter Solomon," the familiar voice of the assistant answered. "This is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier--"

"Yes, Professor Langdon!" The young man sounded relieved. "Thank you for calling back so quickly. 
Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you're on the line. May I put you on hold?"

"Of course."

As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter's name atop the Smithsonian
 letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter's ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London's Royal Society. Solomon's only living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edge discipline called Noetic Science.

All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine's unsuccessful attempt to explain Noetic
 Science to him at a party at her brother's home last year. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, 
"Sounds more like magic than science."

Katherine winked playfully. "They're closer than you think, Robert."

Now Solomon's assistant returned to the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. 
Things are a little chaotic here this morning."

"That's not a problem. I can easily call back."

"Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don't mind?"

"Of course not."

The assistant inhaled deeply. "As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, 
the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our most generous supporters. Many of the country's cultural elite attend."

Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondered 
if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend nonetheless.

"This year, as is customary," the assistant continued, "the dinner will be preceded by a keynote address. 
We've been lucky enough to secure the National Statuary Hall for that speech."

The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall.
 It was hard to forget five hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eight life-size statues, 
in a room that had once served as the nation's original House of Representatives chamber.

"The problem is this," the man said. "Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.
" He paused awkwardly. "This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in."

Langdon did a double take. "Me?" This was not at all what he had expected. "I'm sure Peter could find a far better substitute."

"You're Mr. Solomon's first choice, Professor, and you're being much too modest. 
The institution's guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn't have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involved symbolism in the architecture of our nation's capital--it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue."

Langdon was not so sure. "If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the building than--"

"Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. 
I'm sure they would love to hear you speak on the topic."

I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he'd ever given. "I suppose I could consider it.
 What date is the event?"

The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, actually, sir, it's tonight."

Langdon laughed out loud. "Tonight?!"

"That's why it's so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . ."
 The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. "Mr. Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You're familiar with the private air terminal at Boston's Logan Airport?"

"I am," Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.

"Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . five o'clock?"

"You haven't left me much choice, have you?" Langdon chuckled.

"I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir."

Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. "All right. Tell him I can do it."

"Outstanding!" the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet's tail number and various other information.

When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no.

Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans into the grinder. 
A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It's going to be a long day.
The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National 
Mall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L'Enfant described as 
"a pedestal waiting for a monument." The Capitol's massive footprint 
measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing 
more than sixteen acres of floor space, it contains an astonishing 541 
rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo 
the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the inspiration for 
America's founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic.

The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building is
 located deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center,
 beneath a magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome.
 Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nunez carefully studied the male visitor 
now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been 
lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in a sling,
 and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined with
 his shaved head, made Nunez guess military. Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among 
the most common visitors to Washington.

"Good evening, sir," Nunez said, following the security protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone.

"Hello," the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. "Quiet night."

"NFC play-offs," Nunez replied. "Everyone's watching the Redskins tonight.
" Nunez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he'd drawn the short straw. 
"Metal objects in the dish, please."

As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nunez watched him carefully. 
Human instinct made special allowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nunez had been trained to override.

Nunez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, and a 
couple of cell phones. "Sprain?" Nunez asked, eyeing the man's injured hand, which appeared to be
 wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages.

The bald man nodded. "Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell."

"Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please."

The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.

The visitor frowned. "I was afraid of that. I'm wearing a ring under these bandages. 
My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it."

"No problem," Nunez said. "I'll use the wand." Nunez ran the metal-detection wand over
 the visitor's wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he detected was a large lump 
on the man's injured ring finger. Nunez took his time rubbing the metal detector over 
every inch of the man's sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring
 him on the closed circuit in the building's security center, and Nunez needed this job. 
Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man's sling.


The visitor winced in pain.

"Sorry."

"It's okay," the man said. "You can't be too careful these days."

"Ain't that the truth." Nunez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. 
Human instinct was America's first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact 
that human intuition was a more accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear 
in the world--the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it.

In this case, Nunez's instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. 
The only oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, 
was that this tough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner 
or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.

"You're fine," Nunez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.

"Thanks." The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.

As he did, Nunez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage each bore 
a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of 
his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nunez
 thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. "Those tats hurt?"

The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. "Less than you might think."

"Lucky," Nunez said. "Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was in boot camp."

"A mermaid?" The bald man chuckled.

"Yeah," he said, feeling sheepish. "The mistakes we make in our youth."

"I hear you," the bald man said. "I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning."

They both laughed as the man headed off. Child's play, Mal'akh thought as he 
moved past Nunez and up the escalator toward the Capitol Building. 
The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal'akh's slouching posture 
and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while the makeup on his
 face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The true
 genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal'akh was transporting into the building.

A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek.

CHAPTER 5

The world's largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of the world's best- kept secrets.
 It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. 
Yet despite its magnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside its heavily guarded walls.

Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shaped edifice 
constructed of five interconnected pods--each pod larger than a football field. The building's bluish metal exterio
r barely hints at the strangeness within--a six-hundred- thousand-square-foot alien world that contains a "dead zone,"
 a "wet pod," and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets.

Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove her white Volvo up to the building's main security gate.

The guard smiled. "Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?" He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show.

Katherine forced a tense smile. "It's Sunday night."

"Oh, that's right. Your meeting."

"Is he here yet?" she asked anxiously.

He glanced down at his paperwork. "I don't see him on the log."

"I'm early." Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding access road to her usual parking 
spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearview mirror--more out of force of habit than actual vanity.

Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty 
years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She used almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair
 unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.

You two might as well be twins, people often told them.

Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of
 him. Her brother, eight years Katherine's senior and only fifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting their family name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they were just kids.

Despite her brother's occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. 
Science had become her life partner, and her work had proven more fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine had no regrets.

Her field of choice--Noetic Science--had been virtually unknown when she first heard of it, but in
 recent years it had started opening new doors of understanding into the power of the human mind.

Our untapped potential is truly shocking.

Katherine's two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscure field, but her 
most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noetic Science a topic of mainstream 
conversation around the world.

Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some 
truly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can't believe it's true. She'd thought of nothing else all afternoon.

A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quickly gathered her things to 
get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang.

She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.

Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.

Six miles away, Mal'akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phone 
pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang.

Finally, a woman's voice answered. "Yes?"

"We need to meet again," Mal'akh said.

There was a long pause. "Is everything all right?" "I have new information," Mal'akh said.

"Tell me."

Mal'akh took a deep breath. "That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?"

"Yes?"

"It can be found."

Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. "You're telling me--it is real?"

Mal'akh smiled to himself. "Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason."

CHAPTER 6

Is this as close as you can get?" Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxiety as his driver parked 
on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Building.

"Afraid so," the driver said. "Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I'm sorry, sir."

Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A construction zone around the National 
Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes.

"Weather's turning," the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon's door for him. "You'll want to hurry.
" Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver, but the man waved him off. "Your host already added a very generous tip to the charge."

Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. "Okay, thanks for the ride."

The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of the gracefully arched concourse 
that descended to the new "underground" visitors' entrance.

The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project. Described as an underground 
city to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.

Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn't anticipated quite this long a walk. 
The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and he broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!

When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving 
door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath and brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his 
eyes to the newly completed space before him.

Okay, I'm impressed.

The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because the space was underground,
 Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded
 at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to 
enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.

The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted
 glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.

Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire the architecture, but with five minutes
 until showtime, he put his head down and dashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint 
and escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you're on your way. The event won't start without you.

At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.

"Mickey Mouse?" the guard said, sounding mildly amused.

Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector's edition Mickey Mouse watch had
 been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. "I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriously."

"I don't think it's working," the guard said with a smile. "You look like you're in a 
serious hurry."

Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. "Which way to the Statuary Hall?"

The guard motioned toward the escalators. "You'll see the signs."

"Thanks." Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on. As the escalator ascended,
 Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up through 
the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol 
Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet 
in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. 
Langdon always found it ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a
-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves--a Capitol secret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.

This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a "killer bathtub"
 responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan's long- deceased stuffed horse.

No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this building. 
The spirit of city designer Pierre L'Enfant frequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the Capitol basement--an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure's eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles.

Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, 
following the signs toward the Statuary Hall and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter's assistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.

It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic
 ritual by George Washington himself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons--George Washington,
 Ben Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant-- powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.

Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.

Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington
 along with symbolic messages hidden in the city's layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation
 about the Masons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped
 conceptions about the brotherhood.

Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon's classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street 
map of D.C. on which certain streets had been highlighted to form various shapes--satanic pentacles, a Masonic 
compass and square, the head of Baphomet--proof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C.,
 were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy. "Fun," Langdon said, "but hardly convincing. If you draw
 enough intersecting lines on a map, you're bound to find all kinds of shapes."

"But this can't be coincidence!" the kid exclaimed.

Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Detroit.

The kid seemed sorely disappointed.

"Don't be disheartened," Langdon said. "Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on this street map."

The young man perked up. "Secrets? Like what?"

"Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the course."

"Occult symbols!" The freshman looked excited again. "So there are devil symbols in D.C.!"

Langdon smiled. "Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actually means `hidden'
 or `obscured.' In times of religious oppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or
 `occult,' and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefined anything `occult' as evil, and the prejudice survived."

"Oh." The kid slumped.

Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front row as five hundred students bustled 
into Harvard's Sanders Theatre, a hollow old lecture hall with creaking wooden benches.

"Good morning, everybody," Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, and an 
image materialized behind him. "As you're getting settled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?"

"U.S. Capitol!" dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?"

A scattering of hands went up. "So few?" Langdon feigned surprise. "And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madrid, or London?"

Almost all the hands in the room went up.

As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the 
harsh reality of real life set in. "It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. 
Why do you think that is?"

"No drinking age in Europe!" someone in back shouted.

Langdon smiled. "As if the drinking age here stops any of you?"

Everyone laughed.

It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usual to get settled, shifting and creaking
 in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students 
were simply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.

"Seriously," Langdon said, "Washington, D.C., has some of the world's finest architecture, art, and symbolism. 
Why would you go overseas before visiting your own capital?"

"Ancient stuff is cooler," someone said.

"And by ancient stuff," Langdon clarified, "I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of thing?"

Their heads nodded in unison.

"Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, 
temples . . . it's all there."

The creaking diminished.

"My friends," Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, "in the next hour, you will 
discover that our nation is overflowing with secrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view."

The wooden pews fell dead silent.

Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.

"He pulled it out of his sling," someone said frantically, "and just left it there!"

As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presence hardly warranted screaming.

The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these--life-size plastic models used by sculptors and painters to help them render the human body's most complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda?

Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for sophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its index finger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.

As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and slightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .

Like real skin.

Langdon stopped abruptly.

Now he saw the blood. My God!

The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon's attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on the fourth finger.

No.

Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at the severed right hand of Peter Solomon.

CHAPTER 11

Why isn't Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he?

For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stay up-to-date on Katherine's work at the lab.

He's never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?

Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Known as "The Street," the corridor connected the building's five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building--the pulsing sounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.

Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets from her.

As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the building's more unusual items--the Mars meteorite ALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.

At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. "What in the world is that?!"

Her brother chuckled and kept walking. "Pod Three. It's called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn't it?"

Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was like another planet.

"What I really want to show you is in Pod Five," her brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endless corridor. "It's our newest addition. It was built to house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment."

Katherine glanced over. "Empty? So why are we looking at it?"

Her brother's gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. "It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it."

"Me?"

"Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space--a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you've been developing for all these years."

Katherine stared at her brother in shock. "But, Peter, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible."

"Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it's one of the world's most advanced scientific research facilities. We're constantly taking pieces from the collection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal."

"Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are--"

"Already in place." He smiled broadly. "The lab is done."

Katherine stopped short.

Her brother pointed down the long corridor. "We're going to see it now."

Katherine could barely speak. "You . . . you built me a lab?"

"It's my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experiments you've proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science into uncharted territory." Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes. "Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support this research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead."

"Peter, I can't possibly--"

"Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody's using Pod Five right now. When you're done with your experiments, you'll move out. Besides, Pod Five has some unique properties that will be perfect for your work."

Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that would serve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had just reached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:

POD 5

Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. "You sure you're ready?"

She nodded. My brother, always the showman.

"Stand back." Peter hit the keys.

The steel door hissed loudly open.

Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanating from within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.

"Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses," her brother said, "and you get the basic idea."

Katherine felt herself take a step backward.

"The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder- block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of the pod for maximum separation."

Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. "How far back?"

"Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It's exceptionally dark."

Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. "No light switch?"

"Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity."

"But . . . then how can a lab function?"

He winked. "Hydrogen fuel cell."

Katherine's jaw dropped. "You're kidding, right?"

"Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What's more, all pod exteriors are sealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment."

Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experiments needed to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or "white noise." This included interference as subtle as "brain radiation" or "thought emissions" generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn't work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect.

"Let's go back and have a look." Her brother was grinning as he stepped into the vast darkness. "Just follow me."

Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss.

"Peter?" she called.

"Leap of faith," he called back, his voice already fading away. "You'll find your way. Trust me."

He's kidding, right? Katherine's heart was pounding as she stepped a few feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can't see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. "Peter?!"

Silence.

You'll find your way. Trust me.

Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?

That was three years ago.

Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far she had come since that first night. Her lab--nicknamed the Cube--had become her home, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since--thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had let her discover for herself.

Far more important, her brother's other prediction had come true as well: Katherine's experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the last six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret until the implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations in human history.

A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.

The steel door hissed open.

The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.

Strangest commute on earth.

Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside. Where is Peter?
Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to question the extent of his authority.

Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of police officers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the many security personnel he commanded.

This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his office. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.

"Chief?"

Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button. "Yeah."

"We've got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I've got officers arriving now, but I think you'll want to have a look."

"Right." Anderson walked into the security nerve center--a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. "What have you got?" The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. "Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago." He played the clip.

Anderson watched over the technician's shoulder.

The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson's trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and moving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.

The bald man's footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limped briskly toward the east exit.

Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched closer to the screen and squinted. That can't be what it looks like!

As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, "Mommy, that man dropped something." The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.

Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as he went. "Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!"

Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-worn staircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of the building would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was just ahead.

I can head him off.

As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.

"Excuse me, sir!" Anderson barked, running toward him. "Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?"

The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.

"A bald man with a sling!" Anderson repeated more firmly. "Have you seen him?" The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. "Uh . . . yes," he said. "I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircase over there." He pointed down the hall.

Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. "All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!" He stowed the radio and yanked his sidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.

Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.

Transformation.

It had been so easy.

Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait.

Transformation. This is my gift.

As Mal'akh's mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.

If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete.

Mal'akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would.

CHAPTER 13

For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda--like St. Peter's Basilica--always had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so large that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if there were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.

Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herd distraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright light flashed--a tourist taking a photo of the hand--and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through the crowd, inching closer to the hand.

Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of the fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.

"Everyone back!" an officer called.

Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace.

For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterly unexpected.

A crown . . . and a star.

Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.

On the thumb--a crown. On the index finger--a star.

This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the same place--on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's most coveted and secretive icons.

The Hand of the Mysteries.

The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifact now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.

"Sir?" a guard said behind Langdon. "Please step back." Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see the fingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips would bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.

The hand represents . . . an invitation.

Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite group--those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. The invitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate.

"Sir," the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. "I need you to back up right now."

"I know what this means," Langdon managed. "I can help you."

"Now!" the guard said.

"My friend is in trouble. We have to--"

Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.

A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge.

But it was all madness.

Delusions of a lunatic.

CHAPTER 14

Mal'akh's stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP. I'm in front, Mal'akh thought, smiling to himself.

Mal'akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight--the guarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.

As Mal'akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny's gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal'akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles-- staggering breakthroughs that Mal'akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known.

Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.

For centuries the "brightest minds" on earth had ignored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies--tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation's breakthroughs are proven false by the next generation's technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.

For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the stars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom.

I have come to obscure the light, Mal'akh thought. This is my role.

Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine's revelations, if made public, would become a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination.

Katherine's destiny is to light this torch.

Mine is to extinguish it.

CHAPTER 15

In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry room. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you'd think I'd be used to that. Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space.

The "Cube" was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space into different compartments--a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.

Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.

Despite Noetic Science's use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that were producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science--the untapped potential of the human mind.

The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.

Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no "spoon-bending" parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm.

Mind over matter.

In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the field of Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered that as the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this single tragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators around the world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness of this shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected the randomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringing order from chaos.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a "cosmic consciousness"--a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually capable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had been fascinated by McTaggart's book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study-- theintentionexperiment.com--aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherine's interest.

From this foundation, Katherine Solomon's research had vaulted forward, proving that "focused thought" could affect literally anything--the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems, and the chemical reactions in one's own body. Even the crystalline structure of a newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one's mind; Katherine had created beautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms.

Human thought can literally transform the physical world.

As Katherine's experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that "mind over matter" was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alter the state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.

We are the masters of our own universe.

At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came in and out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: "Living consciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of something into something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe is the consciousness that observes it."

The most astonishing aspect of Katherine's work, however, had been the realization that the mind's ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of "thought" required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become true masters.

This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab's research library and peered in. Empty.

The library was a small reading room--two Morris chairs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred books. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had grown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge and historical. Most of Katherine's books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother's bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.

"The key to our scientific future," her brother often said, "is hidden in our past." A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with an understanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism.

"So tell me, Kate," her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. "What are Elis reading these days in theoretical physics?"

Katherine had stood in her family's book-filled library and recited her demanding reading list.

"Impressive," her brother replied. "Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you reading anything older?"

Katherine scratched her head. "You mean like . . . Newton?"

He smiled. "Keep going." At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring.

Older than Newton? Katherine's head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. "The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."

"Peter," she said, "you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par with modern chemistry, but so what? Today's physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients."

"Like what?"

"Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!" Subatomic research had now proven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a single unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. "You're telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?"

"Absolutely!" Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes. "Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man's oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnection with all things. He has always wanted to become `one' with the universe . . . to achieve the state of `at-one-ment.' " Her brother raised his eyebrows. "To this day, Jews and Christians still strive for `atonement' . . . although most of us have forgotten it is actually `at- one-ment' we're seeking."

Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. "Okay, but you're talking in generalities. I'm talking specific physics."

"Then be specific." His keen eyes challenged her now.

"Okay, how about something as simple as polarity--the positive/negative balance of the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn't underst--"

"Hold on!" Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudly on the library table. "Modern polarity is nothing but the `dual world' described by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature."

Katherine was skeptical. "Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries in subatomics--the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example--"

"Then we must look here," Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. "The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upanishads." He dropped the tome heavily on the first. "Heisenberg and Schrodinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate some of their theories."

The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration. "Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models."

"You're right. They didn't." Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. "If you're talking superstring theory . . ." He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. "Then you're talking this book here." He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk. "Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic."

"Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!" Katherine wasn't buying it. "Come on!"

Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recent scientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.

Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornately printed table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the book. "Read this." He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.

Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory--a ten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. "My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one?!" She took a frightened step backward. "What is this book?!"

Her brother grinned. "Something I'm hoping you'll read one day." He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.

The Complete Zohar.

Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reserved only for the most erudite rabbis.

Katherine eyed the book. "You're saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?"

"Absolutely." He motioned to the page's illustration of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. "Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced."

Katherine didn't know how to respond. "But . . . then why don't more people study this?"

Her brother smiled. "They will."

"I don't understand."

"Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a day when modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him."

That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother's ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today's science was not so much making "discoveries" as it was making "rediscoveries." Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true nature of the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.

Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine's mission in life--to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother's white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.

"No," Katherine said aloud. "It can't possibly be real."

Sometimes a legend was just that--a legend.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment.

Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
Gotcha.

Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. "Who can tell me what George Washington is doing 
here?" The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonic regalia standing 
before an odd-looking contraption--a giant wooden tripod that supported a rope-and- pulley system from 
which was suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.

"Lifting that big block of stone?" someone ventured.

Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.

"Actually," another student offered, "I think Washington is lowering the rock. He's wearing a Masonic costume.
 I've seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone."

"Excellent," Langdon said. "The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the
 cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty." Langdon paused, scanning the class. "Can anyone tell me the significance of that date and time?"

Silence.

"What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons--George Washington, Benjamin
 Franklin, and Pierre L'Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?"

More silence.

"Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo."

Everyone exchanged odd looks.

"Hold on," someone said. "You mean . . . like astrology?"

"Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today."

A hand went up. "You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?"

Langdon grinned. "Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world--zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structured their new world."

"But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo--who cares? Can't that just be coincidence?" "An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the three structures that make up Federal Triangle--the Capitol, the White House, the Washington Monument--were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition."

Langdon's gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes.

A hand in back went up. "Why did they do that?"

Langdon chuckled. "The answer to that is an entire semester's worth of material. If you're curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don't think you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer."

"What?" the person shouted. "Try us!"

Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them. "Sorry, I can't do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I'm afraid it might blow your minds."

"Tell us!" everyone shouted.

Langdon shrugged. "Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learn about it from the source."

"We can't get in," a young man argued. "The Masons are like a supersecret society!"

"Supersecret? Really?" Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. "Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their meeting times in the newspaper?" Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. "My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secrets."

"Same thing," someone muttered.

"Is it?" Langdon challenged. "Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?"

"Of course not," the student said.

"Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?"

"They'd never tell you."

"Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola's deepest secret, you would need to join the company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually rise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might be shared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy." "So you're saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?" "Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously."

"My uncle is a Mason," a young woman piped up. "And my aunt hates it because he won't talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange religion."

"A common misperception."

"It's not a religion?"

"Give it the litmus test," Langdon said. "Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon's comparative religion course?"

Several hands went up.

"Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?"

"ABC," one woman offered. "Assure, Believe, Convert."

"Correct," Langdon said. "Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers." He paused. "Masonry, however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Masonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited."

"So . . . Masonry is anti religious?"

"On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and organized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather together."

"Sounds a little far-out," someone said.

"Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?" Langdon offered. "In this age when different cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness is commendable." Langdon paced the stage. "Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does not discriminate in any way."

"Doesn't discriminate?" A member of the university's Women's Center stood up. "How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?"

Langdon showed his palms in surrender. "A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditionally, in the stone masons' guilds of Europe and was therefore a man's organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women's branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members."

"Nonetheless," the woman said, "Masonry is a powerful organization from which women are excluded."

Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not going to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle.

"Professor Langdon," called a young man with curly hair in the back row, "if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?"

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

"Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition: Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."

"Sounds to me like a euphemism for `freaky cult.' "

"Freaky, you say?"

"Hell yes!" the kid said, standing up. "I heard what they do inside those secret buildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that's freaky!"

Langdon scanned the class. "Does that sound freaky to anyone else?"

"Yes!" they all chimed in.

Langdon feigned a sad sigh. "Too bad. If that's too freaky for you, then I know you'll never want to join my cult."

Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women's Center looked uneasy. "You're in a cult?"

Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood and flesh."

The class looked horrified.

Langdon shrugged. "And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion."

The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. "Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."

The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.

Seven o'clock.

Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National Statuary Hall and headed straight for it.

As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded.

Showtime.

As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks.

Something was very, very wrong.
Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the building's main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she'd just received.

That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.

Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.

Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.

The sign on the door announced:

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

(SMSC)

The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.

Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array of artifacts--giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea, jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building's natural treasures--plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteorite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.

But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to this place not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing.

Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was a small scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline--from physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.

As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. "Ms. Solomon!" He smiled broadly.

"Redskins?"

He blushed, looking guilty. "Pregame."

She smiled. "I won't tell." She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine's eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine's arms.

"So, Ms. Solomon?" the guard whispered jokingly. "Are you ever gonna tell anybody what you're doing back there?"

She glanced up. "Someday, Kyle. Not tonight."

"Come on," he pressed. "A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doing something cool."

Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science.

CHAPTER 8

Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it--a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation's statuary collection--life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.

It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attended here.

Except for one thing.

Tonight, the room was empty.

No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon's grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in there, too.

The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.

He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. "Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?"

The docent hesitated. "I'm not sure, sir. When does it start?"

"Now!"

The man shook his head. "I don't know about any Smithsonian event this evening--not here, at least."

Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn't imagine it. He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter's number.

His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building. Finally, it began to ring.

The familiar southern accent answered. "Peter Solomon's office, this is Anthony. May I help you?"

"Anthony!" Langdon said with relief. "I'm glad you're still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I'm standing in the Statuary Hall, but there's nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?"

"I don't believe so, sir. Let me check." His assistant paused a moment. "Did you confirm with Mr. Solomon directly?"

Langdon was confused. "No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!"

"Yes, I recall that." There was a silence on the line. "That was a bit careless of you, don't you think, Professor?"

Langdon was now fully alert. "I beg your pardon?"

"Consider this . . ." the man said. "You received a fax asking you to call a number, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon's assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?"

Langdon felt a chill race through his body. "Who the hell is this? Where is Peter?"

"I'm afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you're in Washington today." The man's southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous whisper. "You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here."

CHAPTER 9

Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear and paced in a tight circle. "Who the hell are you?"

The man's reply was a silky calm whisper. "Do not be alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason."

"Summoned?" Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Try kidnapped!"

"Hardly." The man's voice was eerily serene. "If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now." He let the words hang for a moment. "My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation." No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one had just crossed a very serious line. "Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I'm hanging up--"

"Unwise," said the man. "Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon's soul."

Langdon drew a sharp breath. "What did you say?"

"I'm sure you heard me."

The way this man had uttered Peter's name had stopped Langdon cold. "What do you know about Peter?"

"At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host."

This can't be happening. "You don't have Peter."

"I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause."

"I'm calling the police."

"No need," the man said. "The authorities will join you momentarily."

What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon's tone hardened. "If you have Peter, put him on the phone right now." "

"That's impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place." The man paused. "He is in the Araf."

"Where?" Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers were going numb.

"The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno?"

The man's religious and literary references solidified Langdon's suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. "You're saying you think Peter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?"

"A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between."

The man's words hung in Langdon's ear. "Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?"

"Not exactly, no." "Not exactly?!" Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A family of tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. "Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!"

"You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between--a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now."

Langdon tried to process this. "What do you want from me?"

"It's simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it with me."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to you?"

Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.

"Look," Langdon said, "if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I know nothing more than--"

"Don't insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon," the man snapped. "I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind's pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only through death."

The stark words left Langdon confused. "Then what the hell is this about?"

The man paused for several seconds. "As you may know, there exists within this city an ancient portal."

An ancient portal?

"And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you--this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been chosen."

And you have lost your mind. "I'm sorry, but you've chosen poorly," Langdon said. "I don't know anything about any ancient portal."

"You don't understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon." "What?" Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.

"Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you."

"If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying."

"I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him."

Langdon felt a stab of anger. "I'm warning you, if you hurt Peter in any--"

"It's far too late for that," the man said in an amused tone. "I've already taken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide what I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way."

Peter? "I thought you said Peter was in `purgatory.'"

"As above, so below," the man said.

Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. "Look, I don't know how to find any ancient portal. I'm calling the police."

"It really hasn't dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?"

"No," Langdon said.

"It will," he replied, chuckling. "Any moment now."

Then the line went dead.

Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened.

Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.

It was coming from the Rotunda.

Someone was screaming.

CHAPTER 10

Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of tourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and several security guards were doing their best to restore order.
